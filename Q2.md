Here is a sample:
```cpp
1 typedef struct nest {  
2 int a;
3 struct nest *next;
4 } nest;
5 nest *start = (nest *)malloc(sizeof(nest));
6 ...
7 start->next->next->next->a = 65536;
```

The assembly of line 7 is shown below:

```nasm
1 mov   -0x8(%ebp),%eax
2 mov    0x4(%eax),%eax
3 mov    0x4(%eax),%eax
4 mov    0x4(%eax),%eax
5 movl   $0x10000,(%eax)
```

- As the above sample shows, we assign the new memory operands (i.e., memory space of addresses -0x8(%ebp) in line 1, 0x4(%eax) in line 2, 0x4(%eax) in line 3,  and 0x4(%eax) in line 4) by hooking memory access operations. And we record these memory operands separately. The address calculation instructions (e.g., memory address plus offset) are caught by AirTaint. Hence, although the value stored in a memory operand (i.e., address) is random, we do not affect the reference relationship among multiple pointers.
