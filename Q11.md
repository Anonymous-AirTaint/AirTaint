- Taking the program gzip as an example, in the experiments with fuzz-style seeds as input, AirTaint, SelectiveTaint and libdft bring a performance slowdown of 1.87x, 3.09x and 1068.84x, respectively. In the experiments with a large seed (a GZ file of vanilla Linux kernel "tarball" (v2.6.35.6; ∼82MB)) as input, the corresponding slowdowns are 3.53x, 11.79x and 5.07x, respectively. Thus, all the three tools are impacted and AirTaint is the best in both scenarios.
- As the following table shows, AirTaint displays a trend of decreasing performance as the number of instructions executed increases. The multiples of instructions executed after instrumenting are approximate(7.x-8.x), while the multiples of performance slowdown rise (from 1.85 up to 3.56). We suspect that it may be due to time slice scheduling or other factors that are orthogonal to the study in this paper.

- The static instrumentation framework, SelectiveTaint, shows the same trend as AirTaint, but libdft is the opposite. While the input is fuzzing-style seeds (small size), libdft’s performance is limited by the dynamic instrumenting itself, such as the high overhead (up to several hundred times) caused by the Intel Pin. However, for large seeds, we note that the effect of the Pin-based instrumenting mechanism becomes weak as shown in the nullpin column of Figure 7.  The performance for large files is mainly related to the number of executed instructions.
