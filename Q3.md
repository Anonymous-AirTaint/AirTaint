We will enrich the accuracy experiment in Section 5.2.1 with a more robust taint tag setting scheme in the revision: for all n operands of a basic block, iteratively select m (0=<m<=n) operands and mark them as tainted to generate a total of $2^n(i.e., 2^n=C_n^0+...+C_n^m+...+C_n^n)$ different taint tag assignments for the more convincible verification.
